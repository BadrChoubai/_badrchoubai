# Hi 👋🏻

## I'm Badr Choubai

I like writing code, sharing tables at coffee shops, reading books, meetups, and thinking. What I'm looking for is a role similar to that of  a trade apprenticeship. A role where I can be immediately valuable, even if it's me just writing  documentation. I want to contribute to projects that have tangible  value, and at a company that aims to do a public good.

### Quick `1s` and `0s`

- I write code in `vim` , PyCharm, and Visual Studio Code
- I manage myself using [Notion.so](http://notion.so), [Self-Control](https://github.com/SelfControlApp/selfcontrol/), and ☕️
- I communicate best through in-person conversation, phone calls, and e-mail (in that order).
- I think best using `.txt` and `.md` files, distractions are evil, and I go to great lengths to eliminate them!
- I've learned most from: *[Skin in the Game](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780425284643), [Atomic Habits](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780735211292), [Thinking in Systems](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781603580557), [Digital Minimalism](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525536512)* and, *[Man's Search for Meaning](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780807014271)*
